# PaliaHotkeys
Workarounds for poor UI.

A Manager can be used and is being developed here: https://github.com/Stefarling/AHKser

Read the documentation for AutoHotKey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/

Scripts are screen resolution dependant, except for the scripts in the "Universal" folder.

Scripts work realiably only in with target apps in Windowed Fullscreen.

Change your script keys in the Hotkeys section of each file, if you want. Default is MOUSE BUTTON FORWARD (XButton2).

!!!! MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING THE RIGHT SCRIPTS FOR THE RIGHT SCREEN SIZE
!!!! WARNINGS ARE WIP

No warranty, what so ever! Use at your own risk! Should be mostly safe. 
Almost no explosions.
... yet.
