# PaliaHotkeys
Attempting to make Palia UI more accesible with less shenanigans. 'Botting' or 'exploits' are **not** meant to be included here.

## Requirements
* Windows OS (Preferably form within the last decade).
* [AutoHotkey V2]() installed. V1 and V2 can coexist, but I only write for V2.
* Nerves of steel.

## Usage
Download the latest batch of scripts from [Stefarling/PaliaHotkeys](https://github.com/Stefarling/PaliaHotkeys/releases/latest) and unzip the folder anywhere.

The scripts can be run individually, as long as the requirements are met. Most scripts are dependant on your screen size, unless specifically labeled ```Universal```. Please be sure to only run scripts for your resolution.

The default hotkey is **Mouse Button Forward** (```XButton2```), but it can be changed by opening the scripts in any [text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and modifying the lines directly. Search for ```; #ANCHOR - Hotkeys``` and replace as needed. You can find most key alternatives listed here: [AutoHotkey Docs](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/KeyList.htm).

I recommend reading up on the latest guides from [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/).

A Script Manager can be used and is being developed here: [AHKser](https://github.com/Stefarling/AHKser). When used with a Script Manager, unzip the scripts into the associated Scripts folder of the manager.

Scripts work realiably only with target apps run in Windowed Fullscreen.

No warranty, what so ever! Use at your own risk! Should be mostly safe. 
Almost no explosions.
